A sample command-line application.# java-bros
Java Bros is a java compiler written in dart. It's name is homage to the Super Mario Bros game. 

## Why dart?
Around the time this repository was created, I was interested in making a compiler and I was interested in doing it in a memorable way. So, I chose dart to make a java compiler.
